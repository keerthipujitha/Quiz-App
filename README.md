# Quiz-App
A Quiz App is an interactive program where users answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback. It tracks the score and displays results at the end.
When the quiz starts, each question will appear one by one with four answer options labeled A, B, C, and D.

Read the question carefully and decide your answer.

Type the letter (A/B/C/D) of your chosen option and press Enter.

The app will instantly tell you if your choice is correct or wrong, and if wrong, it will show the right answer.

Move on to the next question and repeat until all questions are answered.

Once the quiz ends, your final score will be shown so you can see how well you did.

If you want, I can also rewrite this in a fun game-style tone to make it more engaging for players. Would you like that?
